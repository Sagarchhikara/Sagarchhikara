# 👋 Hi there, I’m Sagar Chhikara!

I’m a **Computer Science student** who loves turning ideas into code and chaos into clean, working projects. I dive deep into **web development, AI/ML, and IoT**—always experimenting, breaking stuff, and building it back better.

Curious mind, caffeine-powered nights, and a soft spot for clean UI and smart automation 🚀
